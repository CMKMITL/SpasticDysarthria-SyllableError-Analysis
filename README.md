## Overview

This repository contains the Python code used in the research analysis, organized into two Jupyter notebooks:

1. **`Syllableerror_scoring.ipynb`** – Performs syllable-level error scoring by counting misspellings transcribed from the ASR system for each sentence.
2. **`LogisticRegressionModel_training_testing.ipynb`** – Implements predictive model development and evaluation using logistic regression, including ROC curve illustration.

## License and Citation

The code is publicly available for academic use. If you reuse or adapt the code for academic purposes, please cite the forthcoming article:

## Data Availability

The original data file containing ASR-transcribed syllables for all subjects is not publicly shared due to privacy and data protection regulations in accordance with the ethical review board. Access may be granted upon reasonable request.
